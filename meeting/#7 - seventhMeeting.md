### 🗒️ **Notes**:

*Now that we have a concrete idea of which languages and frameworks we'll use for the frontend and backend, we were 
able to finish some incomplete parts of the key architecture decisions assignment. We discussed the different 
relationships that will have to be in the database and some of the functions that will allow a user to share, unshare, create, and 
delete task calendars. We also talked about how logging in, creating an account, and customizing the color
of the task calendars might work.*
