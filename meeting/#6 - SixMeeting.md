### 🗒️ **Notes**:

During the meeting, we focused on the technical choices and finalized that we will be using HTML for the frontend framework, JavaScript for the backend framework, and MySQL for the database. Next in the meeting, we discussed the database and that we need to determine what data we will store within it and how it will be structured. Brayan showed a draft idea for the database,  with a specific focus on the login and creating user accounts.
