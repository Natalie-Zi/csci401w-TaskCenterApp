### 🗒️ **Notes**:

*We started off by throwing around some ideas about what to name our task managing/organizing product and settled on TaskCentral.
Then, we brainstormed what kinds of people might use our product, and which basic features the product will have to have to meet
those people's needs. It should have user accounts, calendars that hold different assignments/important events, and the ability to share the calendars with other people. 
The software will require a database for storing information. There can be a premium version of the product that users 
buy in order to access more features.*
