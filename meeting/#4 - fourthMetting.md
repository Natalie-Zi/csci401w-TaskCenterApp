### 🗒️ **Notes**:

* We started the discussion on what type of software we should use when developing a mobile application, with two suggestions being Android Studio and Xcode. Next, we discussed the potential challenges we might encounter during the application development process and considered the possibility of shifting to desktop development instead, but no final decision was reached. Afterward, we discussed what our initial focus should be when we start developing the application. The first item on our agenda was creating a login page, and we recognized the necessity of having a database to store the information of created accounts. Finally, we discussed what our priorities should be and what needs to be completed before adding additional features.
