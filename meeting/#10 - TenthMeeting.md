### 🗒️ **Notes**:

*Everyone is able to start the server and visit the pages of the web application, but now we need to develop
the code that will send/retrieve data when the user clicks certain buttons. We all looked at the code we have so 
far in VScode, as well as the sample code that uses jQuery, and talked about how we might use that for our application.
We're planning on meeting in-person to figure out the details together.*
