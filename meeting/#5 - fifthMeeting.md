### 🗒️ **Notes**:

*We simplified the user stories, focusing on the most basic and essential features that the application
needs to have and putting some of the more in-depth features to the side for future implementation if there's
time for them. We also decided it would be easier to make the application web-based and definitively agreed on
which database system we'll use, though we haven't quite decided which frameworks to use for the frontend and 
backend yet.*
