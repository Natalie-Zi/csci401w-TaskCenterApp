## Directions:

This assignment is designed to guide you in understanding the foundational aspects of your project. Remember, in software engineering, understanding the "why" behind decisions is often as important as the decisions themselves. As you navigate these early stages of your coding journey, focus on grasping the core reasons behind each choice, and use this document to record and reflect on those reasons.

## 3. Technical Choices

### 3.1. Frontend Framework

Angular material
We chose this framework because it has many optons we could implement.

### 3.2. Backend Framework

Node.js 
We chose this framework especially because it can be used to connect with our database.

### 3.3. Database System

mySQL, because it's the one we're most familiar with.

---

## 4. Other Considerations

### 4.1. Team Skills and Learning

Nicholas told us he knows something about javascript so we all decided to learn more about it.
Also, we want to learn more about developing web applications.
Furthermore, Bryan has some knowledge about mySQL from previous classes so it looked ideal to use that for database.

### 4.2. Community and Support

Did the availability of tutorials, community support, or other resources influence your choice?
Yes we found various resources we can use for our project.

### 4.3. Future Adaptability

How easy do you believe it will be to adapt or extend the technology choices youâ€™ve made in the future based on your current knowledge?
We think it would be fairly duable to adapt and extwnd our technology choices.

## 5. Decision Log

Here, you'll log key decisions made and the rationale behind them. Here's an example:

| Date       | Decision                                 | Reasoning                                                                                                           |
|------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|2023-8-10| Use MySQL| it's the one at least one team member is more familiar with|
|2023-10-10| Change from mobile app to web app| We believe that we're able to better work with a website and it seemed interesting to learn more about.|
| 2023-10-10 | Chose Javascript for backend   | Our team found that it would be easier to use javascript for backend because we're developing a web application.|
|2023-16-10| Chose Node.js | We decided to use node.js as our backend framework|
|2023-16-10| Chose Angular Material | Angular Material will be used for frontend|


Note: As you progress, keep adding to this log. It will not only help you track your decisions but also offer insights into your evolving
