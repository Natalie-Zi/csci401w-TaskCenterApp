## Directions:

This assignment is designed to guide you in understanding the foundational aspects of your project. Remember, in software engineering, understanding the "why" behind decisions is often as important as the decisions themselves. As you navigate these early stages of your coding journey, focus on grasping the core reasons behind each choice, and use this document to record and reflect on those reasons.

## 5. Decision Log

Here, you'll log key decisions made and the rationale behind them. Here's an example:

| Date       | Decision                                 | Reasoning                                                                                                           |

| 2023-09-01 | Chose React as our frontend framework.   | Our team found an abundance of beginner-friendly tutorials for React. Additionally, two members have some prior exposure to it, making it a logical starting point for our project. |

Note: As you progress, keep adding to this log. It will not only help you track your decisions but also offer insights into your evolving
