## Learning and Growth Journey

### Reflection

Reflect on your journey in learning software engineering through concrete scenarios:

1. **Team Collaboration Approach:**
   Describe how your team used tools like Slack and Trello to coordinate tasks. Share an example of how assigning tasks in Trello helped streamline your group projects and fostered effective communication.

We used Trello to keep track of which team members were working on which user story/function of our web application. For example, if I completed one task, I could quickly go in and look at the "To Do" column in my team's Trello board to see if there was another task I could start doing that wasn't already claimed by someone else.

3. **Challenges and Overcoming Them:**
   Recall a specific challenge, like debugging a code issue together. Explain how you collaborated to identify the bug's source and successfully resolved it. This experience showcases your problem-solving and teamwork skills.

Implementation of the login system and account registration went fairly smoothly. Many issues arose once we started working on coding the actual functions of the calendar, though. One challenge the team had to overcome was giving a user the ability to delete a specific task from a calendar after it had been added. We had trouble figuring out how to make the application know which specific task to delete from the database based on a user's input in the frontend. We all worked on the same version of the code in VScode but tried different things, making small changes until someone eventually stumbled across a functional solution. In the end, we decided to have the app delete tasks by their name; the user is prompted for the name of the task they want to delete, and the application deletes it. Deleting an entire calendar and any tasks associated with it was another complicated function that we would've needed more time to implement, so that ended up being set aside as a feature that could be added in the future.

4. **Accomplishments and Pride:**
   Highlight a feature you contributed to, such as creating a login system. Discuss how your combined skills enabled the team to deliver a functional feature that enhances user experience.

Prior to taking this course, I only really had experience doing backend coding in Java, with an IDE such as Eclipse. Many aspects of coding a web application were completely new to me and I had to learn Javascript, Html, and CSS as I went. By looking at some examples of similar web applications online, I started off with just the basic index.js file that imports the framework and establishes some routes. The structure of the folders and what each section of code in each file does started to make more sense to me as the team made more progress with our project. Some of my teammates had prior experience with Html and CSS and I also looked at the code they contributed as a reference for how to structure my code. One feature I created was a help page where a new user can find answers to some common questions they might have. I tried to think like someone who doesn't know the details of the features that were coded into the application, which helped me come up with those questions. At the start of the software development stage, there was a basic plan for a few team members to specifically handle the backend, but everyone sort of ended up contributing something to the backend since it was complex and required a lot of collaborative trial and error.

6. **Learning and Growth:**
   Provide an example of how you applied a concept learned in class to a practical scenario. Describe how you used version control (like Git) to collaborate on a coding assignment, improving code organization and collaboration.

Creating a separate branch for every team member made it easier to collaborate on GitHub. The source code of our TaskCenter app has a lot of files separated into different folders, and it would've gotten very confusing and convoluted if we only had the main branch. Giving everyone their own branch to work in made it easy for us to keep our work separate and only add our pieces of code to the final version once we'd all agreed on it during our meetings. There were times when my code was missing some important new functions that another team member had figured out, for example, and it was easy for me to see which files had been recently updated in their branch and replace my outdated code with the updated version.

## Product Showcase

### Elevator Pitch

Summarize your product's value proposition with relatable examples. For instance, explain how your app's streamlined user interface improves navigation for users, enhancing their overall experience.

### Product Demo

Share simple examples of your product's functionality:

- **Example 1:** Demonstrate how users can browse product categories using a straightforward navigation bar.
- **Example 2:** Showcase how your cybersecurity-focused feature detects and alerts users about potentially harmful links.

### Technical Architecture Overview

Simplify a technical concept with an example:

- **Example:** Explain the client-server architecture by comparing it to a waiter taking orders (client) and a kitchen preparing food (server).

### Codebase Exploration

Illustrate a coding concept with a relatable analogy:

- **Example:** Describe a conditional statement (like an "if" statement) as a recipe that's followed only if certain conditions, like having all ingredients, are met.

### Access Your Work

- **[Presentation Slides](link-to-presentation):** Share a link to your final presentation slides.
- **[Source Code Repository](link-to-repo):** Provide access to your source code repository.
- **Other Materials:** Include links to diagrams or documents you created for your project.

## Final Reflection Presentation

- **Duration:** 25-minute minimum, 40-minute maximum

## Career Readiness Assessment

Answer the following questions with practical examples:

1. **Team Collaboration Skills:** Reflect on a time when coordinating with team members improved a project's outcome or efficiency.

It was good to have several people making an attempt at solving the problem when we encountered obstacles. Having more eyes on the code led to solutions being found quicker when it came to the calendar functions. Each person looked at the code from a different perspective, so when one team member was dealing with a persistent error or bug, another team member occasionally gave insight that helped them locate it.
   
2. **Problem-Solving Abilities:** Share a situation where you had to troubleshoot a technical issue and how you approached the problem-solving process.

While I was creating the help page, there were moments where the formatting was off and didn't match the look of the home page. I had to look at the CSS style sheets and the html code for the home page, which were written by my teammates, to figure out how to make the navigation bar and headings line up properly.

3. **Contributions to the Project:** Discuss a specific task you contributed to and how your involvement positively impacted the project's development.

I contributed to the project by writing code for a help page where a new user can find guidance for how the calendar's features work. Along with creating the page itself, I created routes for navigating back and forth from the home page to the help page. In the earlier stages of developing the project, I also came up with the early concept of how the user interface and layout might work before we knew whether we'd be making a mobile, desktop, or web app. Some of those ideas carried over into the final product, such as the task list being next to the calendar.
   
4. **Applied Knowledge:** Describe a technical concept learned in class that you've used in your project, highlighting its practical relevance.

I learned a lot about utilizing a framework in backend development of a web application. 
  
5. **Adaptability and Learning:** Provide an example of a challenge you faced that required learning a new skill or concept, and how you adapted to overcome it.
