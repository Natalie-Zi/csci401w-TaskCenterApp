        <b>Why can't I add new tasks to a calendar that was shared with me?</b>
        <p>Inability to add tasks to a calendar means its creator did not give 
            you permission to edit the calendar.</p><br>
        
        <b>How do I delete a task?</b>
        <p>When you click the "Delete Task" button beneath the list of tasks, you'll be asked to type in 
            the name of the task you want to delete. Once you do that and click "ok", that task will be removed
            from that calendar's task list.
        </p><br>

        <b>How do I share a calendar with another user?</b>
        <p>At the upper righthand corner of the home page, there's a blue button labeled "Share" which
            gives the user options to grant another user access to the calendar. It's necessary to know the email of the 
            user who you want to share a calendar with.</p><br>
