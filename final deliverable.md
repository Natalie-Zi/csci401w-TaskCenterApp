## Product Vision

- **Product Vision Statement:**  Task Center is a web-based application that simplifies schedule organization. This software will provide users, including students and employees, with a versatile calendar tool. More in details, it will seamlessly connect with various software platforms, consolidating deadlines and meetings into a single, user-friendly interface.

## Learning and Growth Journey

### Reflection

Reflect on your journey in learning software engineering through concrete scenarios:

1. **Team Collaboration Approach:**
   Describe how your team used tools like Slack and Trello to coordinate tasks. Share an example of how assigning tasks in Trello helped streamline your group projects and fostered effective communication.

Brayan -> The use of Trello proved incredibly helpful in keeping track of incomplete features that needed to be worked on. Overall, the use of Trello helped with our efficiency in managing and completing tasks. 

Natalie->

Nicholas-> I feel like Trello helped the group with organizing and planning what needed to be done. We could clearly see what still needed to be done and what each of us was working on which helped to plan out each step in the process. 

Veronica-> My team used Trello mainly to know which tasks had to be done, were in progress or were completed. As we decided who would work on what we kept updating the members for the task. To communicate outside our meeting we used a groupchat on Team that allowed us to discuss what we were currently working on, if anyone was having an issue and needed help or telling each other when we were done so someone else could test the code on their end.

2. **Challenges and Overcoming Them:**
   Recall a specific challenge, like debugging a code issue together. Explain how you collaborated to identify the bug's source and successfully resolved it. This experience showcases your problem-solving and teamwork skills.
   Brayan->
   
   Natalie->
   
   Nicholas-> One of the coding problems we ran into was when I would commit my work on the front end to my branch in the github and when the Brayan tried to make it work with the database the css would get messed up. Usually during our meetings we would put it on screen and compare what everyone has to see why it was working for some and not everyone.
   
   Veronica-> One of the biggest challenges for me was understanding how to work on all the different files and make them work together. The first feature I worked on fully and had working in the end was the login feature and looking at Bryan's code for the register feature really helped me understand what I needed to do in order to have everything working. At that time we met once in person and it really helped me since it made it easier to show my code and receive feedback from my teammate.


4. **Accomplishments and Pride:**
   Highlight a feature you contributed to, such as creating a login system. Discuss how your combined skills enabled the team to deliver a functional feature that enhances user experience.
   Brayan->
   
   Natalie->
   
   Nicholas-> My part was mainly the frontend. I've had a little experience with html, css, and javascript so I took charge of getting the frontend working. While the rest of the team worked on their parts we would come together and when they had a feature they wanted to implement, such as a share button for calendars shared between users and a calendar selection box for just shared calendars, I would tweak the front end to add those features and work with them to get it working with their stuff.
   
   Veronica-> The delete task feature is what took me probably the longest, I kept working on it full days and I dfidn't understand how to make it work even after watching tutorials and other resources. After couple times I also aked my teammates to review the code I had so far, it finally worked and that felt like a big accomplishment for me.


5. **Learning and Growth:**
   Provide an example of how you applied a concept learned in class to a practical scenario. Describe how you used version control (like Git) to collaborate on a coding assignment, improving code organization and collaboration.
   Brayan->
   
   Natalie->
   
   Nicholas-> I'm new to working with github but I will say that it helped with our project when we each were working on code and we could make a branch for each of us. It helped when we needed to look at what the other person had worked on and compare code.
   
   Veronica-> I liked that each one of us had its own branch on github so that the code didn't get mixed. Periodically when someone had a piece of code working, I would test it out with what was in the main branch and then upload it so that everyone could use it. When we got to code the latest features, we had more issues so it was mostly one tells the other they updated the code so you could go to their branch. That's when we decided to have the draft branch which had the latest working code. As we approached the end and were putting together the final code, I created a final draft branch where I uploaded the code I had after putting all the pieces together and renaming some files, that way if needed someone could download just that branch and have the full code.

## Product Showcase

### Elevator Pitch

Summarize your product's value proposition with relatable examples. For instance, explain how your app's streamlined user interface improves navigation for users, enhancing their overall experience.

### Product Demo

Share simple examples of your product's functionality:

- **Register:** Demonstrate how to create an account and how the email detection and password requirements are showed.
- **Login:** Show how to login
- **Calendar lists and Help page:** Show how to navigate between the homepage and the help page
- **Add a calendar and add task:** Demonstrate how to create a new calendar and add a task
- **Delete a task:** Show what are the steps to delete a task in the calendar
- **Share a calendar:** Show how to add a task and set view or edit permission and how those will function for the user that the calendar was sharesd to

### Technical Architecture Overview

Simplify a technical concept with an example:

- **Example:** Explain the client-server architecture by comparing it to a waiter taking orders (client) and a kitchen preparing food (server).

### Codebase Exploration

Illustrate a coding concept with a relatable analogy:

- **Example:** Describe a conditional statement (like an "if" statement) as a recipe that's followed only if certain conditions, like having all ingredients, are met.

### Access Your Work

- **[Presentation Slides](link-to-presentation):** Share a link to your final presentation slides.
- **[Source Code Repository](link-to-repo):** Provide access to your source code repository.
- **Other Materials:** Include links to diagrams or documents you created for your project.

## Final Reflection Presentation
